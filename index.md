## America's Path to Net Zero
### Updated: December 2021

Since assuming office in January 2021, the Biden Administration has made ambitious decarbonization announcements with the utlimate goal of cross-sectoral net-zero emissions by 2050. Some notable executive actions that President Biden has taken include: 

1. January 27, 2021 – President Biden signs the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/"> Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad </a> Executive Order (EO). 
2. April 22, 2021 – President Biden announces the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement, which pledges that the U.S. will cut net GHG emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030.
3. August 5, 2021 – President Biden signs an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/"> EO </a> declaring a target to make 50% of all passenger vehicles and light trucks sold in 2030 zero-emissions (ZEV) vehicles, including battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in hybrid, or fuel cell electric vehicles. 
4. December 8, 2021 – President Biden signs an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-catalyzing-americas-clean-energy-economy-through-federal-sustainability/"> EO </a> focused on federal sustainability. It mandates 100% light-duty ZEV procurement by the federal government by 2027.

In order to understand how the U.S, can feasibly achieve these decarbonization goals, we must examine the current state of energy consumption in the country and the largest sectoral drivers of demand. Take a look at the figure below to see how energy consumption has changed in this country over the last couple of decades (data from U.S. Energy Information Administration/EIA).

As you can see, energy consumption in the U.S. has slowly increased over time, with some variability (such as dips in the 1970s, during the global oil crisis). Consumption also dramatically decreased across all sectors in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The two sectors with the highest demand are the industrial and transportation sectors, respectively. We'll touch on the challenges around decarbonizing the industrial sector later, but first, let's focus on transportation, which is the target of several recent EOs. 

### Decarbonizing the Transportation Sector 

The transportation sector is currently responsible for 26% of domestic energy demand, with ~90% of that driven by petroleum use. Accordingly, the U.S. transportation sector is one of the largest GHG emitters, with over 58% of those emissions coming from light-duty vehicles (e.g., personal vehicles). 

ZEVs are an important tool for reducing the demand for petroleum-based fuel sources. ZEVs range from plug-in hybrid vehicles that rely partially on internal combustion engines (ICE) to battery electric vehicles with an electric powertrain. Electric motors are three times as energy efficient as ICE and require 40% less maintenance, given the fact that they use substantially fewer components. 

In order to gain insight into the electrification landscape for personal vehicles leading up to 2030, we can look at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) projections of abattery electric vehicle (BEV) counts by U.S. state through 2050. The following figures visualize results from NREL’s Transportation Energy & Mobility Pathway Options (TEMPO) model. Two scenarios are shown: one that is the business-as-usual case, based off of EIA's <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo19/"> Annual Energy Outlook 2019</a>, and one that represents a high electrification pathway, outlined in the <a href= "https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/68214.pdf"> Electrification Futures Study</a>. In the high electriication case, electricity consumption increases as electrified technologies increase in penetration and reach their potential by 2050. Note that the data used does not encompass fleets or medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may entail different types of policy incentives and decarbonization pathways (e.g., biofuels, hydrogen).

If you move the slider on both of these maps to 2030, California stands out as having the highest vehicle count of any state (around 3.6M in the reference, 6.8M in the high electrification). However, at 2050, the divergence becomes stark. In the high electrification scenario, Texas and Florida have also developed significant EV markets. This makes sense, as these are the three most populous states in the country, but the maps help us visualize where the problem areas may be for actualizing this potential and its associated decarbonziation benefits. 

In order to achieve the President's ZEV sales goal by 2030, automakers would need to increase the current market share of ZEVs 13-fold by the end of the decade. The two major <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidundercoffler/2019/09/19/why-shoppers-avoid-electric-vehicles/"> barriers </a> holding consumers back from switching to EVs are the sticker price (largely influenced by the battery cost) and lack of charging infrastucture (which induces range anxiety). Battery costs are falling and light duty EVs are <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/electric-vehicle-models-expected-to-triple-in-4-years-as-declining-battery/592061/"> estimated </a> to reach price parity with interal combustion engine vehicles by 2024. However, charging station availability will remain a challenge without targeted investment. 

There are currently ~110,000 public charging stations in the U.S., but experts say we need at least 5-10 times that amount to achieve the President’s light-duty vehicle sales target by 2030. The major corridors in California, Texas and Florida, as well as the Northeastern metro areas (NY, DC, Boston) will be the regions where investment in EV charging is critical to accelerate deployment and help us reach our ambitious transportation decarbonization goals in the light-duty space. Thus, governemnt investment into building out chargers should focus first on highly trafficked corridors in these regions in order to create economies of scale within the industry and realize the EV adoption that is estimated in the TEMPO model.

### Rest of the Energy Ecosystem

Let's take a quick look at the remaining three sectors: Commercial, Residential, and Industrial (data from <a href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/"> EIA</a>). While electricity sales comprise electricity generation from multiple sources with varying carbon intensities, overall, fossil fuels (natural gas, coal and petroleum) still dominate.

The industrial sector is responsible for the most energy consumed by far, which makes sense because it encompasses <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-challenge-of-decarbonizing-heavy-industry/"> energy-intensive industries </a> such as steel, cement, and chemicals. It will be difficult to decarbonize due to technical factors such as the need for high processing temperatures as well aspolitical and economic factors including low profit margins, capital intensity, and sensitivity to global trade and supply chains. 

This is part of the reason why this Administration is so focused on domestic consumer behavior around light-duty vehicles, as it is a market that the government may more feasibly impact. While electrification seems like ti is the future for vehicles, <a href = "https://issues.org/an-innovation-agenda-for-hard-to-decarbonize-energy-sectors/"> synthetic fuels or alternative fuels such as hydrogen </a> are looming on the horizon for industrial decarbonization and they bring with them a different set of considerations.
