## Driving America's EV Transition
### December 15, 2021

While the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and reconciliation packages work their way through Congress, the Biden Administration has made ambitious decarbonization announcements from the executive angle. Some notable actions that President Biden has taken include: 

1. January 27, 2021 – President Biden signs the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/"> Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad </a> Executive Order (EO). 
2. April 22, 2021 – President Biden announces the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement, which pledges that the U.S. will cut net GHG emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030.
3. August 5, 2021 – President Biden signs an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/"> EO </a> declaring a target to make 50% of all passenger vehicles and light trucks sold in 2030 zero-emissions (ZEV) vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid, or fuel cell electric vehicles. 

In order to understand how the U.S, can feasibly achieve these decarbonization goals, we must examine the current state of energy consumption in the country and the largest sectoral drivers of demand. Take a look at the figure below to see how energy consumption has changed sectorally in this country over the last couple of decades.

The transportation sector is currently responsible for 26% of domestic energy demand, with ~90% of that driven by petroleum use. Accordingly, the U.S. transportation sector is one of the largest GHG emitters, with over 58% of those emissions coming from light-duty vehicles (e.g., personal vehicles). ZEVs are an important tool for reducing the demand for petroleum-based fuel sources. ZEVs range from plug-in hybrid vehicles that rely partially on internal combustion engines (ICE) to battery electric vehicles with an electric powertrain. Electric motors are three times as energy efficient as ICE and require 40% less maintenance, given the fact that they use substantially fewer components. 

There are several obstacles to the widespread electrification of transportation, with two main challenges being the high costs of batteries and the scarcity of charging infrastructure. The battery is still the single most expensive part of an EV, accounting for about 30% of the total cost to consumers.  As a result, the sticker price of an EV is still $7,000-$14,000 higher than its ICE equivalent, making affordability a concern for consumers.   

The availability of charging infrastructure is also a long-standing chicken-and-egg dilemma. “Range anxiety” refers to the common concern amongst prospective EV buyers that they will not be able to find an EV charger when they need one.  As a result, sales of EVs are not growing fast enough to make the EV charging infrastructure business profitable. There are currently ~110,000 public charging stations in the U.S., but experts say we need at least five to 10 times that amount to achieve the President’s light-duty vehicle sales target by 2030. 

In order to gain insight into the electrification landscape for personal vehicles leading up to 2030, we can look at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) projections of vehicle counts by U.S. state through 2050. The following figures visualize results from NREL’s Transportation Energy & Mobility Pathway Options (TEMPO) model. Two scenarios are shown: one that is the business-as-usual case, and one that represents a more optimistic, high electrification pathway. Note that the data used does not encompass fleets or medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which entail different types of policy incentives and decarbonization pathways. 

### Decarbonizing the Transportation Sector

 In order to achieve the President's ZEV sales goal by 2030, automakers would need to increase the current market share of ZEVs 13-fold by the end of the decade.  
 
 The U.S. cities currently leading in the electrification of light-duty transportation are Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle.  In all three of these cities, municipal and state-level electrification goals are supplemented by the adoption of renewable energy sources as an increasing portion of the electric generation. The TEMPO model indicates that the states with the most fully electric light-duty vehicles in 2030 will be California, followed by Washington and Texas, then Florida. These will be the regions where investment in EV charging is critical.
